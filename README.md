# EMG Deep Learning Comparison
## Comparing an LSTM Model to a Independent RNN Model

### Real Time
In order to run this project, use python 3.8.5 and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 
Run `stream.py` and `predict_from_stream.py`. The predictions will be saved to `Saved Data`. The model isn't very good, so it will only guess 0 most of the time.

### The jupyter notebook
This contains the feature extraction, data retrieval, and model training code.
